# FDF

First Graphics Project at HIVE HELSINKI, an introduction to graphics programming.

## Description

This is a school project that made me learn the most this far, it is a passion project of some sorts. It combines the beauty of math and the simplicity of a wireframe. 
The project uses the MLX42 library, which is an OpenGL based library used for developing simple grapics projects. 

## Getting Started

* For windows a Linux subsystem work the best with Xlaunch

### Installing

* run the provided setup.sh script
```
bash setup.sh
```

### Executing program

* just clone the repo and run make build=FULL
* just run the created executable with one of the maps in the maps/ folder
```
make build=FULL && ./fdf maps/42.fdf
```

## Help
